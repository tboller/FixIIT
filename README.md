ITMT 430 Team Project

# FixIIT
FixIIT is a collaborative work of 5 students of the Information Technology Managment (ITM) department of Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). Primarily designed to be a web based application, we have hopes to integrate an Android Application. The purpose of the application is to allow for collaboration between students, faculty, and staff of IIT in deciding what things around campus need to most repair or refurbishment.
