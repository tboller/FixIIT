During this Third sprint I was able to accomplish the following:

- Monitored Github
- Monitored team working on objectives
- Help prepair team for midterm deployment
- kept team on track and updated on project progress
- Continue to work on webdesign 

During the third sprint I was managing the group by making goals that we could meet for the sprint deadline. I also managed the trello board by creating tasks for each team member. In addition, I have done some research on how to create cards that would display our photos on the webpage, to give a social media user expirence when scrolling through content. Lastly, I worked on this sprint 3 report and created the midterm presentation/report for the class.

### Jr. Developer
Leydi Suriano

During this third Sprint I functioned as the Jr. Developer. I was responsible for creating the user and admin page of our platform. Based on the design that our team agreed on in the previous Sprint, I worked along with Vince to complete the layout of the pages, I worked on modifying the CSS to make it look like our proposed design. So far, our design consists of the main page that gives the user the option of sign up or login in, login page where the user can enter their credentials to be validated, user page which will be available to validated users, and admin page which will be available to validated admin users. We successfully completed the tasks that we had for this Sprint and plan to continue perfecting the pages design in the next Sprint.
