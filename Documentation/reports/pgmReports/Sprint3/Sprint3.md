During the third sprint I was managing the group by making goals that we could meet for the sprint deadline. I also managed the trello board by creating tasks for each team member. In addition, I have done some research on how to create cards that would display our photos on the webpage, to give a social media user expirence when scrolling through content. Lastly, I worked on this sprint 3 report and created the midterm presentation/report for the class.
