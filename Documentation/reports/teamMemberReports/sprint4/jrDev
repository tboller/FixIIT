# Junior Developer
## Sprint 4

For this sprit Thomas Boller was the Jr. Developer The following was accomplished:

- Made minor style fixes to front end pages
- Connected Angular Front End Register page to the Database through the back end.
- Started the connection to the backend from login page.

For this sprint I mostly focused on figuring out the connection to the back end. Next sprint I will be connecting the login page, then
connecting the ticketing to the back end.  With those connections the main purpose of our site will be functional.
