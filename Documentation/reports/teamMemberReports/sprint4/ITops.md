# IT Ops
## Sprint 4

For the first sprint, Emmanuel functioned as the IT ops. The following was accomplished:

- Added functionality to create, view, update, and delete tickets through the backend API. Testing was done using Postman.

For this sprint we focused on setting up the main functionality of the application which is to report tickets. For the next sprint we will integrate this with the front end.
