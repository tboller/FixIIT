During the fourth sprint, I have continued to develop the web pages for our site. I have added a background image of the IIT campus for our index and login page, the purpose of this was to give users a feel of the location of our campus. Also, I have modified the index and login boxes to be somewhat transparent with the background image. Futher, I have created an upload button for us to use on the backend that way users can upload their own photos of items they would like to fix. I have created a Terms of Use page and implemented a legal statement for uses to understand the Terms of using our webapplication that is embeded in a scroll box. I have also created a contact page that has general information about us and how users can contact us for support. In addition, I have added two photos for our user page and admin page for the purpose of giving a visial effect on how the web application will display on the endusers side.
