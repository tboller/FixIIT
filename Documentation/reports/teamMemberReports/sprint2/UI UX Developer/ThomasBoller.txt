For the second sprint I started by getting the git pull automation to work with our rsa keys. After that I  was tasked with making a username and password login system for our application. I am not well versed in the MEAN stack so I spent considerable time studying.  I utilized a tutorial on CRUD application development for the MEAN stack as well as javascript and node.js tutorials by theNewBoston. As of Wednesday I was still unable to finish the login system.
