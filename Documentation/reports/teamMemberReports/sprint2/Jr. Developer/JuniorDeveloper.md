# JRDeveloper
## Sprint 2

For the first sprint, Emmanuel functioned as the jr developer. The following was accomplished:

- Added functionality to register and log in user through the backend. Testing was done using Postman.

For this sprint we focused on creating a necessary component of any application which is to authenticate users. There is still some things that need to be fixed. For the next sprint we will fine tune the authentication and start incorporating some of the necessary features of our application (posting a ticket, adding voting functionality, etc.)
