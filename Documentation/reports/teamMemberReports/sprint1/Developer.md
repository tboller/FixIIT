# Developer
## Sprint 1

For the first sprint, Emmanuel functioned as the developer. The following was accomplished:

- Planned the application architecture and technologies that will be used.
- Created Hello World application using angular and express.
- Setup up hosted online database, mLab, and setup user accounts.

Alot of research was done during this sprint. Research that helped us plan our application architecture and began the setup of the application. For the next Sprint, we plan to build off what has already been created. Our development goals for the next sprint are:

- Add user-login functionality. From past experience, we have come to the conclusion that this should be done first. This includes, beginning to work with the database and use a technology such as passport.js.
- Implement the UI that the UI/UX developer created.
