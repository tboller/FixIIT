# UIUX Developer
## Sprint 3

For the third sprint, Emmanuel functioned as the UI/UX developer.

For this sprint we focused on starting with the front end of the application with Angular. Many tutorials were followed and online documentation was read since everyone is new to the framework. We still have to work on it but the components were built in angular. For the next sprint we will keep working on the front end for the authentication. We will also start working on creating tickets.
