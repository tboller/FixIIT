## Sprint 4

For this sprint Thomas Boller was the Developer The following was accomplished:

- Corrected error that on build register/login functionality failed
- Built full login functionality using jwt authentication
- Built Authentication service that prevents unauthorized access
- Designed script to remove hardcoding of MLab username and password
- Minor connections and issue fixes

For this sprint I was tasked with ensuring our web app could be opened from a browser, an account registered, and user logged in securely.
There are honestly many tasks I have yet to do, despite this being the final sprint. I look forward to working on this even after our class is finished.
