Matteo Giaimo

I have an associates degree from the College of Dupage in Computer internetworking and technology. I am also CCNA certified by Cisco, and as well have a certificate in CCNA security. The background i come from is more on the hardware and infrastructure side. I am skilled in creating networks, building servers, system administration, testing the builds, and documenting. My weakness is on the development side, i am not that creating with creating applications but i know how to get the applications run on the servers.
