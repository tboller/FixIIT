This Sprint I have reviewed the html code that I have worked on throughout the project development to make sure there was no issues with our html pages and css pages. Then, I have reviewed the angular component code that was recoded from our html/css pages, in order to work with our background architecture. Furthermore, I have done some research to help find the solution to implement the https protocol within our web application project, after doing some research it was still a challenge for us to implement on our webpages. Overall, I think our team has done a good job on getting as much as we could accomplish for our last sprint.
