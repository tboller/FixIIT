Thomas Boller Background
Within the IT world my background is limited to what I have done in school.  I have
worked the most in programming and scripting. I have worked with several scripting languages
such as Bash, Powershell, and Perl. In the programming world I had worked with C, C++, Java,
Python, Android, XML and some limited amount I had worked with ORM.  This was my first major
foray into Javascript and web application developlment, both front and back end. It was also the 
first I had worked with tools such as Packer, Vagrant, and Git.
