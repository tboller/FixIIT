## Sprint 5

For this sprint I continued to work on the design of our angular pages. Finished separating the css to have only one css file per html page, this way it was easier to code the design of our angular pages. I was also tasked with creating the diagram of the workflow of our web pages and making sure that our original diagrams are similar to our final design.
