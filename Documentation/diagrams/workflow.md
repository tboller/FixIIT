## Workflow:

1. Decide what type of web page we want to create.
2. Make rough sketch.
3. Define set of elements we want to add in our web page.
4. Design the frontend in HTML+CSS and fill it with dummy data to see whether it looks nice.
5. Don't use complicated code. Simple is better.
6. Design the backend.
7. Code javascript that gets stuff from the backend and displays it on the frontend.
8. Test our code and make it flawless.
